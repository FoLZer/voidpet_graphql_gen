## Info
This script is created only to get graphql-related information from Voidpet.com and save it for additional processing and usage later.

This script will generate 2 files after being run:
- queries.graphql
- schema.graphql

queries.graphql will contain all the queries that are available on the client.

schema.graphql will contain graphql schema(types and unions) but without Scalar types(as they're unavailable on the client)

## Ownership
Both generated files are property of Voidpet authors: 
- [benawad](https://github.com/benawad)
- [lindashad](https://www.tiktok.com/@lindashad)
